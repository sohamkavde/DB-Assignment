## 1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

In our setup, we have two main things: products and product categories.

Imagine you have a bunch of products like shoes, shirts, and hats. Each of these products belongs to a specific category, like "Footwear" for shoes or "Apparel" for shirts. This connection between products and their categories helps organize things neatly.

Now, let's focus on how this works behind the scenes:

1. **Product Category**: This is like a folder where similar products are grouped together. For example, all types of shoes could be in the "Footwear" category.

2. **Product**: Each individual item like a shoe or a shirt is a product. Now, to know which category a product belongs to, we use something called a "category ID". It's like a label that tells us which category the product falls under. This ID points to the specific category in our system.

So, when you look at a product, you can find its category by checking its category ID. It's a simple way to organize products and make sense of them when there are many different types.

## 2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can implement referential integrity constraints in your database schema. Here's how you can do it:

**Foreign Key Constraint**:  In the database schema, I've set up a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column of the "Product" table. This constraint ensures that every value entered into the "category_id" column must match a valid primary key value in the "Product Category" table.

**Database Validation**: I've implemented database triggers or stored procedures that run before any insert or update operation on the "Product" table. These triggers or procedures check if the specified "category_id" exists in the "Product Category" table. If it doesn't, the operation is aborted or rolled back, ensuring that only valid category IDs can be assigned to products.
